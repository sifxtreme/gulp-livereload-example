# gulp-livereload-example
=====================

Getting started - be sure to have Node install before entering the following commands.

```
npm install
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 5000
```

Now open a new Terminal window and run:
```
gulp watch
```

Edit your LESS files and they will automatically compile into the CSS folder.

You will also need to install [this plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei/related%22this%20plugin%22) to make it work.
